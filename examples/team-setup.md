# AI Development Team Setup Example

This example shows how to set up a complete AI development team using Claude Code agents, with auto-configuration and team coordination patterns.

## Quick Team Setup

### Step 1: Auto-Configuration Command

```bash
"Use team-configurator to set up my AI development team for this project"
```

The team configurator will:
1. Analyze your project structure
2. Detect technology stack
3. Create appropriate agent mappings
4. Update CLAUDE.md with team configuration

### Step 2: Manual Team Setup

For more control, you can manually configure your team:

```markdown

- What's planned for today?
- Any blockers?"

Expected Output:
## Daily Standup - [Date]

### Frontend Team
âœ… Completed: Login component with validation
ðŸ“‹ Today: User dashboard layout
ðŸš« Blockers: Need API endpoint for user data

### Backend Team
âœ… Completed: Authentication endpoints
ðŸ“‹ Today: User profile CRUD operations
ðŸš« Blockers: None

### Test Team
âœ… Completed: Auth endpoint tests
ðŸ“‹ Today: Integration tests for user flow
ðŸš« Blockers: Waiting for frontend components
```

### 2. Architecture Review Meeting

```markdown
"Conduct architecture review with:
- Tech Lead presenting design
- Security Auditor reviewing vulnerabilities
- Performance Expert analyzing bottlenecks
- Database Architect checking data model"
```

### 3. Sprint Planning

```markdown
"Plan next sprint with team:
1. Review backlog items
2. Estimate complexity
3. Assign to appropriate agents
4. Identify dependencies"
```

## Team Workflow Automation

### 1. Feature Development Flow

```yaml
# .claude/workflows/feature-development.yml
name: Feature Development

steps:
  - name: Requirements Analysis
    agent: tech-lead-orchestrator
    action: Analyze requirements and create task breakdown
    
  - name: Technical Design
    parallel:
      - agent: backend-architect
        action: Design API structure
      - agent: frontend-architect
        action: Design component hierarchy
      - agent: database-architect
        action: Design data model

  - name: Investigation
    agent: debugger
    action: Reproduce and identify root cause
    
  - name: Fix Development
    agent: $specialist  # Assigned based on bug type
    action: Implement fix
    
  - name: Test Creation
    agent: test-engineer
    action: Add regression test
    
  - name: Verification
    agent: qa-engineer
    action: Verify fix and check side effects
```

## Team Performance Metrics

### 1. Velocity Tracking

```markdown

- **Story Points**: 34
- **Bugs Fixed**: 12
- **Tech Debt Addressed**: 3 items

### By Agent
- backend-developer: 12 points
- frontend-developer: 10 points
- test-engineer: 8 points
- devops-engineer: 4 points

### Bottlenecks
- Frontend waiting on API specs
- Tests blocked by implementation
```

### 2. Quality Metrics

```markdown
## Code Quality Dashboard

### Coverage
- Overall: 87%
- Backend: 92%
- Frontend: 81%

### Code Review
- Average review time: 2 hours
- Issues found: 23
- Critical issues: 2

### Security
- Vulnerabilities found: 0
- Security tests: 45
```

## Team Scaling Strategies

### 1. Growing the Team

```markdown
As project grows, add specialized agents:

Phase 1 (MVP):
- Generalist agents
- Basic coverage

Phase 2 (Growth):
- Add specialists
- Domain experts

Phase 3 (Scale):
- Performance experts
- Platform engineers
- SRE specialists
```

### 2. Team Rotation

```markdown
Prevent agent fatigue by rotating responsibilities:

Week 1-2: Agent A leads backend
Week 3-4: Agent B leads backend
Result: Fresh perspectives, knowledge sharing
```

## Best Practices for AI Teams

1. **Clear Roles**: Each agent should have defined responsibilities
2. **Communication Protocols**: Establish how agents share information
3. **Escalation Paths**: Define when to involve human developers
4. **Regular Retrospectives**: Review team performance
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Update agent configurations based on learnings

## Troubleshooting Team Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

```markdown
Problem: Agents giving conflicting advice
Solution: Establish clear hierarchy and decision authority

Problem: Too much overhead in coordination
Solution: Reduce team size, increase agent autonomy

Problem: Agents missing context
Solution: Improve handoff protocols, use shared documentation

Problem: Duplicate work
Solution: Better task assignment, clear ownership
```

Remember: The goal is to create a collaborative AI team that enhances your productivity, not to replace human judgment. Use the team to handle routine tasks, explore options, and accelerate development while maintaining human oversight for critical decisions.
