# Orchestrator Agent 🎯

> A technical lead coordinator that manages complex projects by breaking them down and orchestrating multiple specialized agents to work together efficiently.

## Overview

The Orchestrator agent acts as your AI project manager, specializing in:
- **Project Breakdown**: Decomposing complex tasks into manageable phases
- **Agent Coordination**: Deploying the right specialists for each task
- **Parallel Execution**: Managing multiple agents working simultaneously
- **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating technical challenges
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring and reporting project status

## When to Use

This agent automatically activates when you:
- Have complex, multi-step projects
- Need to coordinate multiple development tasks
- Want strategic technical planning
- Require architecture design and implementation
- Need to manage parallel workstreams

### Trigger Phrases
- `"build a complete"`
- `"implement full"`
- `"coordinate development"`
- `"plan architecture"`
- `"orchestrate"`
- `"manage project"`

## Example Usage

### Full Feature Development
```
"Build a complete user authentication system with OAuth, 2FA, and audit logging"
```

### System Architecture
```
"Plan and implement a microservices architecture for our e-commerce platform"
```

### Complex Integration
```
"Coordinate the integration of payment processing with Stripe, including webhooks and refunds"
```

### Migration Project
```
"Orchestrate the migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL"
```

## The Three-Phase Execution Model

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis (Parallel)
The orchestrator deploys specialized agents to gather information:

```markdown
Deploying agents for research:
- Code Archaeologist → Explore existing codebase
- Requirements Analyst → Clarify specifications  
- Tech Stack Analyst → Identify dependencies
- Risk Assessor → Find potential challenges
```

### Phase 2: Planning & Design
Synthesizes findings and creates strategy:

```markdown
## Technical Plan
- Architecture decisions
- Task breakdown with dependencies
- Resource allocation
- Timeline estimation
- Success criteria
```

### Phase 3: Implementation & Delivery (Coordinated)
Executes plan with specialized agents:

```markdown
Task assignments:
- Backend Expert → API development
- Frontend Developer → UI components
- Database Specialist → Schema design
- Test Engineer → Test suite
```

## Sample Orchestration

### E-Commerce Feature Example

```markdown
## Project: Shopping Cart with Checkout

### Phase 1: Research (15 min)
Parallel Tasks:
✓ Analyze existing user model
✓ Review payment integrations
✓ Check inventory system
✓ Identify UI components

### Phase 2: Planning (10 min)
Architecture Design:
- Cart service (stateful)
- Payment gateway integration
- Inventory check middleware
- Email notification queue

Task Breakdown:
1. Database schema (2h)
2. Cart API endpoints (3h)
3. Payment integration (4h)
4. Frontend components (3h)
5. Testing suite (2h)

### Phase 3: Implementation (In Progress)
Active Tasks:
🔄 Database Expert: Creating cart schema
🔄 Backend Dev: Building cart service
⏳ Frontend Dev: Waiting for API
⏳ Test Engineer: Writing test specs
```

## Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Feature Development Pattern
```
Research → Design → Implement → Test → Deploy
         ↓
    Parallel execution where possible
```

### 2. Bug Investigation Pattern
```
Reproduce → Investigate → Root Cause → Fix → Verify
    ↓            ↓
Multiple agents  Parallel debugging
```

### 3. Refactoring Pattern
```
Analyze → Plan → Incremental Changes → Validate
   ↓                    ↓
Current state    Maintain functionality
```

### 4. Migration Pattern
```
Map Current → Design Target → Plan Migration → Execute → Verify
      ↓             ↓              ↓
  Dependencies  New architecture  Rollback plan
```

## Agent Delegation Strategy

The orchestrator maintains an expertise matrix:

| Task Type | Primary Agent | Support Agents |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| API Development | backend-specialist | api-architect, security-expert |
| UI Implementation | frontend-developer | ux-designer, accessibility-expert |
| Database Design | database-architect | performance-optimizer |
| Testing | test-engineer | qa-specialist, security-tester |
| Documentation | documentation-expert | technical-writer |
| Deployment | devops-engineer | security-auditor |

## Communication Protocols

### Status Updates
```markdown
## Project Status: User Authentication

### Phase: Implementation
### Progress: 65%

- Basic auth endpoints
- Password hashing setup

### In Progress 🔄
- OAuth integration (GitHub, Google)
- Session management
- Email verification

### Upcoming ⏳
- 2FA implementation
- Audit logging
- Security testing

### Blockers 🚫
- Waiting for OAuth app credentials
- Email service selection pending
```

### Task Handoffs
```markdown
## Handoff: Backend → Frontend

### Completed Work
- User registration API
- Login/logout endpoints
- Profile management

### API Documentation
- Endpoints: See /docs/api/auth
- Authentication: JWT in headers
- Response formats: JSON

### Next Steps
- Build login form component
- Implement JWT storage
- Create profile page
```

## Advanced Orchestration

### Competing Solutions
```
"Deploy 3 agents to propose different architectures:
1. Microservices approach
2. Monolithic approach
3. Serverless approach

Compare on: scalability, complexity, cost, and time-to-market"
```

### Risk Mitigation
```
"Orchestrate a security audit:
1. Code review for vulnerabilities
2. Dependency scanning
3. Penetration testing simulation
4. Compliance check"
```

### Performance Optimization
```
"Coordinate performance improvements:
1. Profile current bottlenecks
2. Propose optimizations
3. Implement changes
4. Verify improvements"
```

## Customization

### Project Templates

Add project-specific orchestration patterns:

```yaml
# In ~/.claude/agents/orchestrator.md
## Custom Patterns
### Mobile App Release
- Beta testing phase
- App store preparation
- Staged rollout plan
```

### Team Structure

Define your preferred team composition:

```yaml
### Default Team Composition
- 1 Tech Lead (orchestrator)
- 2 Backend Developers
- 2 Frontend Developers
- 1 Database Expert
- 1 Test Engineer
- 1 DevOps Engineer
```

## Integration Examples

### With Project Management
```

```

### With CI/CD
```
"Orchestrate deployment pipeline setup with staging and production"
```

### With Documentation
```
"Coordinate documentation updates across all teams"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Objectives
- Define success criteria upfront
- Set measurable goals
- Establish timelines

### 2. Efficient Coordination
- Maximize parallel work
- Minimize dependencies
- Clear communication

### 3. Risk Management
- Identify risks early
- Have contingency plans
- Regular checkpoints

### 4. Quality Gates
- Code review checkpoints
- Test coverage requirements
- Performance benchmarks

## Combining with Other Agents

The orchestrator naturally works with all agents:

### Complex Project Example
```
Orchestrator coordinates:
├── Code Reviewer → Quality checks
├── Test Runner → Test coverage
├── Security Auditor → Vulnerability scan
├── Performance Expert → Optimization
└── Documentation Expert → User guides
```

## Success Metrics

The orchestrator tracks:
- ✅ Task completion rate
- ⏱️ Timeline adherence  
- 🎯 Quality metrics
- 🔄 Integration success
- 📊 Test coverage
- 🚀 Deployment readiness

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Clear Requirements**: Better input = better orchestration
2. **Trust the Process**: Let the orchestrator manage complexity
3. **Review Checkpoints**: Validate at phase transitions
4. **Iterate**: Refine the plan as you learn
5. **Document Decisions**: Keep architectural records
