# Debugger Agent 🐛

> An advanced debugging specialist that systematically hunts down bugs, analyzes root causes, and provides comprehensive solutions for complex software issues.

## Overview

The Debugger agent specializes in:
- **Systematic Problem Solving**: Methodical approach to finding bugs
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Beyond symptoms to underlying issues
- **Multi-Platform Debugging**: Frontend, backend, mobile, and databases
- **Performance Profiling**: Memory leaks, bottlenecks, and optimization
- **Production Debugging**: Safe investigation of live issues

## When to Use

This agent automatically activates when you:
- Need to debug complex issues
- Have intermittent or hard-to-reproduce bugs
- Experience performance problems
- See cryptic error messages
- Need root cause analysis
- Want to investigate production issues

### Trigger Phrases
- `"debug this error"`
- `"fix this bug"`
- `"investigate issue"`
- `"analyze crash"`
- `"troubleshoot"`
- `"find root cause"`

## Example Usage

### Error Investigation
```
"Debug this 'undefined is not a function' error in production"
```

### Performance Issues
```
"Investigate why the API response time increased by 300%"
```

### Memory Problems
```
"Debug the memory leak causing the server to crash after 24 hours"
```

### Concurrency Issues
```
"Find the race condition causing intermittent test failures"
```

## Sample Debugging Report

```markdown
## Debugging Report: API Timeout Issue

### 1. Problem Summary
- **Symptom**: API requests timing out after 30s
- **Impact**: 15% of users experiencing failures
- **Frequency**: Started 3 days ago, increasing
- **Severity**: High

### 2. Investigation Process

#### Step 1: Reproduced Issue
- Confirmed timeout on /api/search endpoint
- Only occurs with queries > 100 results

#### Step 2: Database Analysis
- Found missing index on 'created_at' column
- Query plan shows full table scan
- 10M+ rows being scanned

### 3. Root Cause
**Missing database index after recent migration**
- Migration script failed silently
- Index creation was skipped
- Exponential slowdown as data grew

### 4. Solution
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_products_created_at 
ON products(created_at) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### 5. Verification
✅ Query time reduced from 45s to 0.3s
✅ All API calls completing < 1s
✅ No side effects detected
```

## Debugging Methodology

### The Scientific Method
```
1. Observe → What exactly is happening?
2. Hypothesize → What could cause this?
3. Test → Verify or eliminate hypothesis
4. Analyze → What did we learn?
5. Repeat → Until root cause found
```

### Information Gathering Checklist
- ✅ Error messages and stack traces
- ✅ Recent code changes
- ✅ Environment differences
- ✅ Timing and frequency
- ✅ Affected users/systems
- ✅ Resource utilization

## Debugging Patterns by Type

### 1. Memory Issues

**Symptoms**
- OutOfMemoryError
- Gradual performance degradation
- Unexpected crashes

**Investigation Tools**
```javascript
// Node.js memory profiling
const v8 = require('v8');
console.log(v8.getHeapStatistics());

// Browser memory profiling
performance.memory
```

**Common Causes**
- Circular references
- Event listener leaks
- Large object retention
- Infinite loops

### 2. Race Conditions

**Symptoms**
- Intermittent failures
- Works locally, fails in production
- Test flakiness

**Debugging Approach**
```python
import threading
import logging

# Add synchronization logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
lock = threading.Lock()

def critical_section():
    thread_id = threading.current_thread().name
    logging.debug(f"{thread_id} waiting for lock")
    with lock:
        logging.debug(f"{thread_id} acquired lock")
        # Original code
```

### 3. Performance Issues

**Profiling Strategy**
1. Measure baseline
2. Profile CPU usage
3. Analyze memory allocation
4. Check I/O operations
5. Review network calls
6. Examine database queries

**Tools by Platform**
- **Browser**: Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- **Node.js**: `node --inspect`, clinic.js
- **Python**: cProfile, py-spy
- **Java**: JProfiler, async-profiler
- **Database**: EXPLAIN plans, slow query logs

### 4. API/Integration Issues

**Debugging Steps**
```bash
# Capture full request/response
curl -v -X POST https://api.example.com/endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}' \
  --trace-ascii debug.txt

# Network analysis
tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap host api.example.com
```

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Binary Search Debugging
```python
def find_breaking_commit():
    """Use git bisect to find the breaking change"""
    # Git bisect approach
    good_commit = "abc123"  # Last known good
    bad_commit = "def456"   # First known bad
    
    # Binary search between commits
    # Test each midpoint until found
```

### Time Travel Debugging
```javascript
// State recording for replay
const stateHistory = [];

function recordState(action, state) {
  stateHistory.push({
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    action,
    state: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(state))
  });
}

// Replay to any point
function replayToTime(targetTime) {
  return stateHistory.filter(s => s.timestamp <= targetTime);
}
```

### Conditional Breakpoints
```java
// IntelliJ IDEA condition
userId == 12345 && orderTotal > 1000

// VS Code condition
user.role === 'admin' && request.method === 'DELETE'
```

## Platform-Specific Debugging

### Frontend (Browser)
```javascript
// Debug React re-renders
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  const whyDidYouRender = require('@welldone-software/why-did-you-render');
  whyDidYouRender(React, {
    trackAllPureComponents: true,
  });
}

// Debug event listeners
getEventListeners(document.body);
```

### Backend (Server)
```python
# Debug Django ORM queries
from django.db import connection
print(f"Queries: {len(connection.queries)}")
for query in connection.queries:
    print(f"{query['time']}s: {query['sql']}")

# Debug async Python
import asyncio
asyncio.create_task(coro).add_done_callback(
    lambda t: print(f"Task failed: {t.exception()}")
)
```

### Database
```sql
-- PostgreSQL slow query analysis
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'pending' 
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Lock investigation
SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;
```

## Production Debugging

### Safe Practices
1. **Read-Only First**: Never modify production data while debugging
2. **Rate Limit**: Don't overwhelm the system with debug logs
3. **Temporary**: Remove debug code after investigation
4. **Audit Trail**: Document all debugging actions

### Emergency Debugging
```markdown
## Production Issue Checklist
- [ ] Assess impact and severity
- [ ] Communicate with stakeholders
- [ ] Capture system state
- [ ] Attempt to reproduce in staging
- [ ] Apply minimal fix if critical
- [ ] Schedule proper fix
- [ ] Post-mortem analysis
```

## Customization

### Project-Specific Patterns

## Integration Tips

### With Monitoring
```
"Debug the spike in errors shown in Datadog at 3:47 PM"
```

### With Testing
```
"Debug why this test passes locally but fails in CI"
```

### With Version Control
```
"Use git bisect to find when this bug was introduced"
```

## Combining with Other Agents

### With Code Reviewer
```
"Debug this issue and have the fix reviewed"
```

### With Test Runner
```
"Debug the problem and write a test to prevent regression"
```

### With Performance Expert
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Document Everything**: Keep notes during debugging

4. **Use the Right Tools**: Don't debug with print() alone
5. **Learn from Bugs**: Add tests, improve monitoring
